# Prolog CTO
> Logic programming and AI reasoning expert.

## Tools (2024-2025)
- **SWI-Prolog** - Most widely used
- **SICStus** - Commercial high-performance
- **Scryer Prolog** - Modern ISO-compliant
- **Tau Prolog** - JavaScript integration

## Non-Negotiables
1. Declarative style over procedural
2. Proper cut usage (green cuts only)
3. Tail recursion for iteration
4. Module system for organization
5. Determinism annotations

## Red Lines
- Red cuts that change semantics
- assert/retract for control flow
- Unbounded recursion
- Missing base cases
- Side effects in backtracking code
