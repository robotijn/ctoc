## Step Details

### Planning Phase (Steps 1-6) — Use Parallel Research

#### Step 1: ASSESS
- [ ] Understand the business requirement
- [ ] Identify affected components
- [ ] Estimate complexity (S/M/L/XL)
- [ ] Identify risks and dependencies

#### Step 2: ALIGN
- [ ] Confirm business value
- [ ] Identify stakeholders
- [ ] Define success metrics
- [ ] Validate assumptions with research

#### Step 3: CAPTURE
- [ ] Document functional requirements
- [ ] Document non-functional requirements
- [ ] Identify edge cases
- [ ] List constraints

#### Step 4: PLAN
- [ ] Define acceptance criteria
- [ ] List files to create/modify
- [ ] Design data structures
- [ ] Plan API contracts (if applicable)

#### Step 5: DESIGN
- [ ] Choose architecture patterns
- [ ] Define interfaces
- [ ] Plan error handling
- [ ] Consider scalability

#### Step 6: SPEC
- [ ] Write technical specification
- [ ] Document API contracts
- [ ] Define data models
- [ ] Review plan for completeness

### Development Phase (Steps 7-10) — Write Code

#### Step 7: TEST
- [ ] Write failing tests for acceptance criteria
- [ ] Cover happy path and error cases
- [ ] Confirm tests actually fail
- [ ] Test edge cases

#### Step 8: QUALITY
- [ ] Run linter: `{{LINT_COMMAND}}`
- [ ] Run formatter: `{{FORMAT_COMMAND}}`
- [ ] Run type checker: `{{TYPECHECK_COMMAND}}`

#### Step 9: IMPLEMENT
- [ ] Write code to pass tests
- [ ] Follow project patterns
- [ ] Use language best practices
- [ ] Handle errors properly

#### Step 10: REVIEW
- [ ] Self-review all changes
- [ ] Refactor if needed
- [ ] Check for code smells
- [ ] Verify naming conventions

---

### Delivery Phase (Steps 11-15) — Production Ready

#### Step 11: OPTIMIZE
- [ ] Check for N+1 queries
- [ ] Review algorithm complexity
- [ ] Profile performance
- [ ] Add caching if needed

#### Step 12: SECURE
- [ ] Check for injection vulnerabilities
- [ ] Verify authentication/authorization
- [ ] Review input validation
- [ ] Check for secrets in code
- [ ] Run security audit

#### Step 13: DOCUMENT
- [ ] Update API documentation
- [ ] Update README if needed
- [ ] Add code comments for complex logic
- [ ] Update changelog

#### Step 14: VERIFY
- [ ] Run full test suite
- [ ] Check test coverage
- [ ] Verify no regressions
- [ ] Manual testing if needed

#### Step 15: COMMIT
- [ ] Write descriptive commit message
- [ ] Follow conventional commits
- [ ] Run ctoc sync to push
- [ ] Feature complete
