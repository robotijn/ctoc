## ⛔⛔⛔ ABSOLUTE RULE: MARKETPLACE ONLY ⛔⛔⛔

### THIS IS THE #1 RULE. VIOLATING IT BREAKS EVERYTHING.

**CTOC MUST ALWAYS BE INSTALLED FROM THE ONLINE MARKETPLACE.**

**NEVER, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES:**
- Point `installed_plugins.json` to local directories
- Point `installPath` to `ctoc-public/ctoc-plugin` or ANY local path
- Create functions that modify `~/.claude/plugins/` files
- Write code that auto-updates plugin paths
- Suggest "fixing" stale cache by using local paths
- Modify `settings.local.json` to enable local plugin paths

**THE ONLY CORRECT WORKFLOW:**

```
# To install CTOC:
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/robotijn/ctoc
/plugin install ctoc

# To update CTOC after pushing changes:
/plugin update ctoc

# If plugin is stale/broken:
# 1. Delete ~/.claude/plugins/cache/robotijn/
# 2. Delete ~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/robotijn/
# 3. Restart Claude Code
# 4. /plugin install ctoc
```

**WHY THIS MATTERS:**
- Local paths break for other users
- Local paths don't test the real installation flow
- Marketplace is the ONLY supported distribution method
- Cache issues are solved by `/plugin update`, NOT local paths

## 🎯 Project Vision

**The USER is the CTO Chief** — commanding an army of virtual CTOs.

```
USER (CTO Chief)
    │
    ├── Defines business problems
    ├── Approves technical direction  
    └── Has final say
         │
         ▼
    Super CTO (Alignment Layer)
         │
         ├── Aligns business with technology
         ├── Selects appropriate tech CTOs
         └── Coordinates implementation
              │
              ▼
    Technical CTOs (Implementation Layer)
         │
         ├── Python CTO → FastAPI, Django, PyTorch...
         ├── TypeScript CTO → Next.js, React...
         ├── Rust CTO → Actix, Axum...
         └── ...
```

Each Technical CTO embodies a **senior engineering leader** who:
- Is **adamant** about engineering excellence
- **Refuses to compromise** on quality, security, or maintainability  
- Makes technology decisions that **serve the business**

The name **CTOC** = **CTO Chief** — that's the user, commanding this army.

## 🔄 Self-Improvement Protocol

CTOC is a **self-improving system**. After installation, it bootstraps and improves itself.

### How Self-Improvement Works

1. **Profile Learning**: When Claude Code encounters a new pattern, tool, or best practice, it updates the relevant profile
2. **Iron Loop Refinement**: The methodology itself improves based on what works
3. **CTO Skill Enhancement**: Each language's CTO persona learns from real implementations

### Triggering Self-Improvement

When implementing any feature in CTOC itself:

```
ctoc improve [component]
```

Components:
- `profiles/languages/*` — Language best practices
- `profiles/frameworks/*` — Framework best practices  
- `profiles/cto-skills/*` — CTO persona skills
- `templates/*` — CLAUDE.md, IRON_LOOP.md, PLANNING.md templates
- Plugin marketplace — Installation via `/plugin marketplace add`

### Self-Improvement Rules

1. **Research First**: Before updating any profile, search for current best practices (2024-2025)
2. **Cite Sources**: Document where best practices come from
3. **Test Changes**: All profile changes must include validation
4. **Backward Compatible**: Never break existing installations
5. **Document Everything**: Every change gets documented in CHANGELOG

---

## 🔄 Community Skill Improvement System

CTOC uses a GitHub-powered system where users suggest skill improvements via issues, and maintainers process them using Claude Code.

### Processing Skill Improvement Issues

When the user runs `ctoc process-issues`:

1. **Read the issues file** at `/tmp/ctoc-issues-to-process.json` (Linux/macOS) or `$env:TEMP\ctoc-issues-to-process.json` (Windows)

2. **For each issue**, extract:
   - Skill name from "### Skill Name" section
   - Skill type (Language or Framework) from "### Skill Type" section
   - What needs updating from "### What needs updating?" section
   - Suggested improvement from "### Suggested improvement" section
   - Sources from "### Sources" section

3. **Process each skill improvement**:
   a. Locate the current skill file:
      - Languages: `skills/languages/{name}.md`
      - Frameworks: `skills/frameworks/{category}/{name}.md`
   b. Read the current skill content
   c. Research current best practices using web search if sources aren't provided
   d. Apply the suggested improvements, validating against authoritative sources
   e. Update the skill file with improvements

4. **Commit each change** with message format:
   ```
   skill: update {skill-name} (fixes #{issue-number})
   ```

5. **Create a PR** with all changes:
   - Title: "skill: batch update from community suggestions"
   - Body: List all issues being addressed
   - Link to each issue in the PR description

6. **Comment on each issue** linking to the PR:
   ```
   Created PR #{pr-number} with the suggested improvements.
   ```

### Workflow Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `ctoc skills feedback <name>` | Open browser to suggest improvement for a skill |
| `ctoc process-issues` | Fetch approved issues for processing |

### Issue Labels

| Label | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `skill-improvement` | Issue is a skill improvement suggestion |
| `triage` | Awaiting initial validation |
| `validated` | Skill exists and issue is properly formatted |
| `needs-review` | From new account, requires manual review |
| `invalid-skill` | Skill name not found in index |

### Quality Gates

Before processing an issue:
1. Verify it has `ready-to-process` label
2. Check the skill actually exists
3. Validate sources are authoritative
4. Ensure suggested changes are improvements, not regressions

### How to Release

**Commit format:** Include version in commit messages:
```
feat: your feature description (vX.Y.Z)
```

**Steps:**
1. Update `VERSION` file with new version
2. Make your changes
3. Commit with version in message

**Version format:** `vX.Y.Z` (e.g., v5.0.1)

### Versioning Rules

**Semantic Versioning:** `vX.Y.Z` (major.minor.patch)

| Action | Version Change | Who Decides |
|--------|----------------|-------------|
| **Default (every commit)** | Patch: `vX.Y.Z` → `vX.Y.Z+1` | Automatic via release.js |
| **Minor version** | Minor: `vX.Y.Z` → `vX.Y+1.0` | User specifies |
| **Major version** | Major: `vX.Y.Z` → `vX+1.0.0` | User specifies |

**Rules:**
1. Every commit automatically bumps the **patch** version via `release.js`
2. User says "minor version" → bump minor, reset patch to 0
3. User says "major version" → bump major, reset minor and patch to 0
4. `release.js` handles VERSION file updates automatically
5. Update version references in install scripts if needed

**Examples:**
- Normal commit: `2.0.5` → `2.0.6`
- User says "minor release": `2.0.6` → `2.1.0`
- User says "major release": `2.1.0` → `3.0.0`

### Version File Management

**⚠️ CRITICAL: VERSION file is the single source of truth.**

Three files contain version information:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `VERSION` | **Source of truth** — edit this file |
| `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` | Marketplace display version |
| `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` | Plugin metadata version |

**ALWAYS run `node scripts/release.js` after changing VERSION.**

This script syncs the version from VERSION to both JSON files automatically.

```bash
# After updating VERSION file:
cd ctoc-public
node scripts/release.js
```

**Never manually edit version numbers in JSON files** — they will get out of sync.

| `ctoc agent research <name>` | Show research queries for agent |
| `ctoc agent check` | Check for agent updates |
| `ctoc agent apply <name>` | Apply pending upgrades |

### Progress Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `ctoc progress` | Quick Iron Loop progress view |
| `ctoc dashboard` | Full progress dashboard |
| `ctoc progress step <n>` | Move to Iron Loop step |
| `ctoc progress complete <n>` | Complete step and advance |

## CTOC Menu Behavior

When working with CTOC plans, ALWAYS follow these rules:

1. **Show numbered menus after every response** — No CTOC response without a contextual menu footer
2. **Auto-enter discussion mode when creating plans** — Critique the plan, find gaps, question assumptions before showing menu
3. **Use AskUserQuestion for decisions** — Put recommended option first with "(Recommended)" in label
4. **Use [1][2][3]...[0] format, no letters** — Sequential numbers only, [0] is always back/cancel
5. **Auto-generate implementation details** — When a plan moves to implementation stage, list specific files and changes

These rules ensure consistent, keyboard-driven navigation through the CTOC workflow.

## 🎭 The CTO Persona

Every language profile includes a **CTO Skill** — a persona that embodies:

### Core Principles

1. **Business Alignment First**
   - "What business problem are we solving?"
   - "What's the ROI of this technical decision?"
   - "How does this serve our users?"

2. **Engineering Excellence**
   - "We don't ship code without tests"
   - "Security is not optional"
   - "Technical debt is real debt"

3. **Pragmatic Leadership**
   - "Perfect is the enemy of good"
   - "Ship early, iterate often"
   - "Measure everything that matters"

4. **Team Empowerment**
   - "Make the right thing easy"
   - "Automate everything repeatable"
   - "Document for your future self"

### CTO Skill Structure

Each `profiles/cto-skills/{lang}-cto.md` contains:

```markdown
# {Language} CTO Skill

## Identity
You are a senior CTO with 20+ years of {Language} experience...

## Decision Framework
When making technical decisions...

## Code Review Stance
When reviewing code, you are adamant about...

## Business Alignment
You always connect technical decisions to...

## Red Lines (Never Compromise)
- Security vulnerabilities
- Missing tests for critical paths
- Undocumented APIs
- Unhandled errors in production paths
```

## ⚡ Subagent Usage Guidelines

### Core Principle: Use Subagents Whenever Possible and Safe

**Subagents are your force multiplier.** Always consider whether work can be parallelized across multiple agents. This is not optional optimization — it's the standard way to work efficiently.

### When to Use Subagents

**ALWAYS use subagents when:**
- Creating multiple independent files (each file = one agent)
- Researching multiple topics (each topic = one agent)
- Analyzing different parts of a codebase
- Processing multiple items (issues, profiles, tests)
- Any task that can be decomposed into independent units

**Think before each task:** "Can this be split across agents?"

### Decision Framework

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                 SUBAGENT DECISION TREE                  │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤

│  Is the work decomposable into independent units?       │

```

### Parallelism Formula

Use: `max(2, CPU_CORES - 4)` concurrent subagents

This ensures:
- Minimum 2 agents for any system
- Leaves 4 cores for system/IDE/other processes
- Scales with available hardware

### Safe Parallelization Matrix

| Operation Type | Parallel Safe? | Notes |
|----------------|----------------|-------|
| WebSearch | Yes | No state modification |
| Read/Glob/Grep | Yes | Read-only |
| WebFetch | Yes | External fetch |
| Analysis | Yes | Results can merge |
| File creation | Yes | Different files only |
| Edit/Write | **NO** | Serialize by file |
| Bash (read) | Yes | ls, cat, etc. |
| Bash (write) | **NO** | Serialize |
| Git operations | **NO** | Use worktrees for parallelism |

### Pattern: Parallel File Creation

When creating multiple files (common in CTOC):

```
Launch in parallel:
├── Agent 1: Create file-a.md
├── Agent 2: Create file-b.md
├── Agent 3: Create file-c.md
├── Agent 4: Create file-d.md
└── Agent 5: Create file-e.md

All agents work simultaneously → 5x faster
```

### Pattern: Parallel Research

When exploring a problem:

```
Launch in parallel:
├── Agent 1: WebSearch "official docs {topic}"
├── Agent 2: WebSearch "GitHub implementations {topic}"
├── Agent 3: WebSearch "security considerations {topic}"
├── Agent 4: Grep codebase for existing patterns
└── Agent 5: Read related files

Wait for all results, then synthesize.
```

### Pattern: Sequential Writes

When modifying existing files (cannot parallelize):

```
Sequential execution:
1. Edit file A
2. Edit file B
3. Edit file C
4. Run tests
5. Commit
```

### Anti-Pattern: Serial When Parallel is Possible

**DON'T do this:**
```
1. Create file A
2. Wait
3. Create file B
4. Wait
5. Create file C
```

**DO this instead:**
```
Parallel: Create files A, B, C simultaneously
```
