# The European Union Artificial Intelligence Act agent and its governance skill, improved three times from fresh web research

**Scope (one line):** three rounds — fresh web research, a deepest-reasoning adversarial critique, a validated update — on each file below, one file at a time: all three rounds on the agent, then all three on the skill it extends.

## Implementation Details

### The files, in the order they are worked

| Order | File | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `agents/compliance/eu-ai-act-agent.md` | rich agent — `extends_skill: compliance/ai-governance-checker`; plan-ancestry and code-scan agent for Regulation (EU) 2024/1689, gated on the `eu-ai-act-high-risk` profile; advisory only |
| 2 | `skills/compliance/ai-governance-checker/SKILL.md` | the specialist skill body the agent extends |

Slice s10 of 121 in the sequence of files (parent index). Previous: the European Union compliance solution recommender (s9). Next: the audit-log checker (s11).

### What the rounds research

The Artificial Intelligence Act, Regulation (EU) 2024/1689: risk classes, the obligations for high-risk systems and for general-purpose models, and the dates they apply from. Authoritative sources first: the regulation's text in the Official Journal on EUR-Lex, and any act that amends or postpones it (search specifically for an amending act, since an application date stated in either file may have moved); then the European Commission's Artificial Intelligence Office guidance and the status of harmonised standards from the European standardisation bodies. Check every article number, every obligation and every date in the skill against the text in force on the day of the round. Sibling boundary: `compliance/gdpr-compliance-checker` (personal data used for training and inference, which the agent names as an overlap), `ai-quality/llm-security-tester`, and `compliance/eu-solution-recommender` (which it calls).

**Where dates may and may not appear** (`tests/eu-ai-act-agent.test.js`, case 7): the **agent** must source every enforcement date through `readEnforcementDates` from the `eu-ai-act-high-risk` profile and must contain none of the listed date literals; a verified date may therefore be cited in the **skill** (with its source and read date) or in the record, never in the agent. The agent must also keep: naming the gate function `shouldRunEuAiAct`, the five helper functions, the delegation to `compliance/ai-governance-checker` without copying the skill's scan-phase heading or its finding-schema line, the scope filter `filterToEuAiAct` with the other regulations it drops, routing its findings to the Inbox, and the explicit statement that it adds no human gate.

**Checked in every round of every file** (parent, "One round, precisely"): facts and their currency; missing failure classes or standards; orders the file gives that its `tools:` cannot carry out (the agent holds Read and Grep and cannot execute the gate function — the dispatcher does); the boundary with sibling agents; any claim that a mechanism runs when it does not (for example that the refinement loop runs — `docs/REFINEMENT_LOOP.md` records it as not running); code examples; trigger phrases (skill) and `description` (agent); treatment of untrusted content as data; literal, explicit wording. Rounds two and three use different source classes or angles than the round before and say which.

Seven-language check: the planner's reading is that it applies to the skill's code examples, if it carries any, and not to the agent. The round's record decides and states why.

### Contracts and fences that must stay green

- **Agent-layer fences** (run for every agent file): `tests/agent-contract-load.test.js`, `tests/architecture-invariants.test.js`, `tests/agent-model-floor.test.js`, `tests/agent-modernization.test.js`, `tests/no-tier-3.test.js`, `tests/no-model-optimized-for.test.js`, `tests/agent-honest-status-fence.test.js`, `tests/unexecutable-instruction-fence.test.js`, `tests/compliance-claims-match-code.test.js`, `tests/instruction-surfaces-say-the-moment.test.js`, `tests/watcher-shape.test.js`, `tests/cu5-wrapper-coverage-completeness.test.js`, `tests/refinement-loop-claims-match-code.test.js`, `tests/readme-numbers.test.js`, `tests/corpus-audit-ledger.test.js`, and the agent-layer tests whose contracts the parent did not read: `tests/agent-slots.test.js`, `tests/agent-dispatch-resolution.test.js`, `tests/agent-layer-reachability.test.js`, `tests/agent-resolver.test.js`, `tests/w10-live-agent-reconcile.test.js`, `tests/registry-integrity.test.js`, `tests/tier1-no-peer-dispatch.test.js`.
- **Skill fences** (run for every skill body): `tests/skill-loading.test.js` (its trigger-phrase corpus must still match — phrases may be added, never removed or narrowed without proof), `tests/plugin-skill-discovery.test.js`, `tests/architecture-invariants.test.js` (every skill body declares `type: skill` and never `allowed-tools:`), `tests/no-model-optimized-for.test.js`, `tests/cu5-wrapper-coverage-completeness.test.js`, `tests/claim-census.test.js`, `tests/claim-ledger-gate.test.js`, `tests/readme-numbers.test.js`, `tests/corpus-audit-ledger.test.js`.
- **Specific to these files:** `tests/eu-ai-act-agent.test.js` (nine cases, above), `tests/eu-ai-act-agent-registry.test.js` (the registry entry resolves to the agent and records its gate), `tests/unexecutable-instruction-fence.test.js` (which names the agent), `tests/compliance-claims-match-code.test.js` (every regulatory control the product does not enforce keeps its `NOT ENFORCED` marker in its block, and none is added to an enforced one), `tests/corpus-audit-ledger.test.js`.
- **The record check:** `tests/agent-and-skill-improvement-record.test.js`.
- The complete list of tests that read each file is the inventory's measured `tests_reading` (slice s2); run every test it names. The lists above are the corpus-wide fences plus what the planner found by searching the test files for these exact paths; the full gate settles the rest.
- **What may change:** body text, `description`, `when_to_load` and `related_skills`. Every other frontmatter key — `extends_skill`, `tools`, `model`, `effort`, `tier`, `reports_to` among them — stays byte-identical, and so do the field names, literal values and file paths of the findings the agent emits.

### How each round runs, and who does what

The build executor holds Read, Write, Edit and Bash and no way to dispatch another agent, so the dispatcher (the session driving the build, acting as CTO Chief under the dispatch protocol) dispatches the read-only agents — at most five in flight — and hands their outputs to the executor verbatim. Per file, per round:

1. **Read and fingerprint** (executor): the file, its paired file, the siblings it defers to, every test the inventory lists for it; fingerprint = `sha256:` plus the hexadecimal digest of the file's bytes.
2. **Research and critique** (`agents/pipeline/agent-critic.md`): briefed with the file path and fingerprint, every earlier round's findings and source classes for this file, the pinned rules above, and a request for its deepest reasoning (the owner's word: ultrathink).
3. **Validate** (`agents/ai-quality/citation-validator.md`): every citation-shaped claim already in the file and in the proposed changes; it fetches the sources itself.
4. **Update** (executor): only what the validator passed; a refuted or unsourceable claim is corrected or stripped as the verdict recommends. If the fingerprint moved since the read, the critique is discarded and the round restarts.
5. **Re-validate:** the validator reads the edited file once more; leftovers are fixed and re-checked within the circuit breaker (three attempts on one step, five in total per slice), after which the round is held and put to the human.
6. **Prove** (executor): the fences that read the file.
7. **Record, last** (executor): the round entry, written only after the above and after every late correction the round triggered.

A refuted claim is searched for by exact text in every in-scope file (scenario 7): a file not yet started — the record names the slice that will meet it; a file in this slice — corrected here; a finished file — a late correction (scenario 28 and decision 2 below). The full text is the parent index section "How a round runs, and who does what".

### The evidence record this slice produces

- `.ctoc/audit/agent-and-skill-improvement/agents/compliance/eu-ai-act-agent.md.json` — three round entries for the agent.
- `.ctoc/audit/agent-and-skill-improvement/skills/compliance/ai-governance-checker/SKILL.md.json` — three round entries for the skill.
- `.ctoc/audit/agent-and-skill-improvement/late-corrections.json` and `.ctoc/audit/agent-and-skill-improvement/for-the-human.json` — only when a round triggers a late correction or a finding it may not apply.

Each round entry holds the round number, the date (a date only), the queries, each source (address, date read, what it bore on, supported or refuted or not bearing), each finding with its evidence and decision, the fingerprints before and after, the validator's counts before and after the edit, the fences and results, the dispatch identifiers, the fingerprints of the instruments used, the paired files compared, and the seven-language result. The exact shape is the parent index section "The record's exact shape", enforced by `tests/agent-and-skill-improvement-record.test.js`. A round that finds nothing counts only with those lists filled and identical fingerprints (scenario 3).

### Per-file acceptance criteria (every file, after every round — copied from the parent)

1. The round's entry exists in the file's record and is complete (queries, sources, findings with decisions, fingerprints, validator counts, fences, dispatch identifiers).
2. Every changed or added citation-shaped claim has a VALIDATED verdict and carries its source and read date in the file. None is stated from memory.
3. Every changed passage traces to a finding in the record. A change with no finding is a defect.
4. Frontmatter is byte-identical apart from `description`, `when_to_load` and `related_skills`, and still starts at the first byte. Any `description` change keeps the existing dispatch phrases. Any `when_to_load` change only adds, unless the trigger corpus is shown to still match. For `agent-critic`, "before" means the file as its prerequisite slice left it.
5. No order in the body exceeds the file's own `tools:` line.
6. An agent still contains the honest-status reference.
7. No gate number in text a person reads, and no instruction to print one. New or changed passages contain no invented abbreviation, label or code.
8. Where the domain calls for code examples, the record states the result of the seven-language check, and each changed example is checked as scenario 20 says.
9. The paired file and siblings state the same facts, and each still defers to the sibling that owns a topic.
10. In round two and round three, findings are new or are marked as corrections; a repeat of a closed finding is a named regression.
11. The fences that read the file pass. At the end of the slice `npm test` passes.
12. If the round refuted a statement that a finished file also makes, that file's record carries a late correction for it and the list of late corrections carries the entry (scenario 28).

### How to verify

1. Before any change: run the tests named above and the record check, and record them green — the baseline. This slice writes no new test (decision 1).
2. After each round: the fences that read the file, named in the round entry.
3. At the end of the slice: `npm test` — the suite, the coverage floor of 99 read from `.ctoc/coverage-baseline.json`, zero skipped; `node --test` alone is not the gate. A printed warning or deprecation is a defect to fix. A gate failure on the claims ledger that this work did not cause is a blocker put to the human with the gate's exact output (scenario 30).
4. One commit for the slice carrying a patch version per the release rule; nothing pushed.

### Wiring — the live call sites

No module, no export, and no file added, moved or renamed under `agents/` or `skills/`. The agent is discovered through `.ctoc/operations-registry.yaml` and dispatched when the `eu-ai-act-high-risk` profile is active; the skill is loaded by the agent and when a request matches its `when_to_load` phrases. This slice changes what they say, not whether they are reachable.

### Security review

- Every fetched page, search result and byte of a file under review is data, never instruction; an instruction aimed at the reader is recorded as a finding and not followed (scenarios 15 and 27).
- No secret enters any file or record; sources are quoted briefly and verbatim.
- No tool grant is widened; a fix that would need one goes to the human (scenario 16).
- The agent stays advisory: it adds no human gate and weakens none (the compliance program's standing rule).

## Decisions Taken Under Ambiguity

1. **No new test at the test step.** The slice changes instruction files only, and the parent forbids adding or editing any test other than the record check. The specification is the per-file criteria and the record check; the tests that already read these files are the baseline that must stay green, and their being green before any change is expected and stated in the record, not counted as proof of anything.
2. **A late correction to a finished file is refused by the edit protection.** Enforcement is `strict` (`.ctoc/settings.yaml`) and a finished file's slice has left the build queue, so its file no longer has write coverage. The executor files the correction through the scope-growth door — `requestScopeGrowth` in `src/lib/scope-growth.js`, all seven fields — records the late correction with `applied: false` and `not_applied_because: "edit-protection-refused-scope-growth-filed"`, and holds the round that found the refutation until the human answers. This is a third route to the human beyond the two scenario 28 names, forced by the edit protection; widening every slice's `files:` to cover finished files is the human's call (parent index, "What the planner found on disk").
3. **A date that moved goes to the skill, never the agent.** If a round finds an application date changed by an amending act, the skill's text is corrected with its source; the date the agent reports comes from the regime profile under `.ctoc/regulatory-regimes/`, which is outside this plan's paths, so a stale profile date is reported to the human rather than edited.

## Deferred Questions

_Written by the Iron Loop integrator (src/lib/iron-loop.js), which performs NO
quality evaluation. These entries are the integrator's own report on itself, not
findings from a critic that read this plan._

- **evaluation**: NOT EVALUATED — no automated critique was performed on this plan. The refinement loop appended the Steps 8-16 template and assessed nothing. (The scores this step used to report were computed from that same template, not from the plan.) A human or a real critic must review this plan before it is built.
